## Features

- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR):** Provides instant feedback during development.
- **ESLint:** Configured to enforce code quality and style guidelines.
- **Fast Refresh:** Supported through two official plugin options:
  - [`@vitejs/plugin-react`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md), which utilizes [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for a seamless development experience.
  - [`@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc), which leverages [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for fast compilation.
